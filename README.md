# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Testing is important in ensuring the quality of the software we create. How can we know that anything actually works without testing it first? We may assume it works, and this may get us into trouble. Instead it is important to examine the functional requirements of the software and create and execute test cases that ensure these requirements are meant. It is good for showing that the code works and documenting those results for others. In this project we used JUnit 5 for automated unit testing of some sample code.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs are captured in documentation and can be directly translated into programming requirements. In the form of stories or in other forms, a good software project will be shaped around meeting the needs of the user. Testing is also focused on ensuring that the user needs are met. Further, we ensure that the user experience is made as comfortable as possible, and testing should often including checking edge cases that the user may inadvertently enter.

# How do I approach designing software?

Good software, coming from a user standpoint, is software that 'works'. That means software that does what you want it to do and doesn't do what you don't want it to. From a programmer standpoint, good software is well written in accepted design patterns that will be easy to read and maintain. A good approach to software design unifies these standpoints, thinking about the user requirements as well as how best to approach the problem from a coding stanpoint. Finally, quality software will have to be well tested at each revision, and automated testing is crucial for this. We seek to incorporate testing methodology throughout the development lifecycle to accomplish this.
